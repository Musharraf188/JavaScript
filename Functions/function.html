    <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

        A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
        <p>Why Functions?
            You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
            
            You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.</p>
