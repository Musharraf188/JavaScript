    <h2>JavaScript Const</h2>
    <p class="A">The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

        Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
        
        Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
        
        Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</p>
        <p class="B">When to use JavaScript const?
            Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
            
            Use const when you declare:
            
            A new Array
            A new Object
            A new Function
            A new RegExp</p>
            <p class="C">Constant Objects and Arrays
                The keyword const is a little misleading.
                
                It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
                
                Because of this you can NOT:
                
                Reassign a constant value
                Reassign a constant array
                Reassign a constant object
                But you CAN:
                
                Change the elements of constant array
                Change the properties of constant object</p>
