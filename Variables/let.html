    <h2>Diffrence between let & const..</h2>
    <h4>let</h4>
    <p>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015). <br>

        Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared. <br>
        
        Variables defined with let must be Declared before use. <br>
        
        Variables defined with let have Block Scope.</p> <br>
        <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. <br>
        
            ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. <br>
            
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. <br>
            
            Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</p>
        <h2> <b> With var you can.. </b></h2>
        <h3> <span>Note: Redeclaring a variable with let, in another block, IS allowed:</span> </h3>
