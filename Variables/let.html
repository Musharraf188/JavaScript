        <p>Cannot be Redeclared <br>
            Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared. <br>
            
            You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable. <br>
            
            With let you can not do this:</p>
        <h2> <b> With var you can.. </b></h2>

    <div class="theory">Block Scope
        Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
        
        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
        
        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
        
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</div>
